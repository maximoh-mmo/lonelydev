    description: "Prophecy of Ash is set within the vast desert canyons of Solmora — the final refuge of the elven races after their lands were consumed by a spreading corruption. Take the role of an emergent hero in the Last Refuge, explore a map filled with dangerous foes, and develop your magical and melee prowess to stem the tide of corruption. The game features tactical real-time combat, level and equipment-based progression, a main quest with multiple stages, and ten different side quests, each with their own sub-stages.",
    shortDescription: "A third-person adventure set in the desert canyons of Solmora, where players battle corrupted creatures and explore the last refuge of the desert elves. Built in Unreal Engine 5.5 over 8 weeks.",
    team: "Created by Games Academy students over 8 weeks with a large multidisciplinary team including 3 producers, 4 programmers, 9 artists, plus external audio and support specialists. As one of the programmers on this ambitious project, I worked alongside Max Heinze (Lead Programmer), Marcel Jahn (Quest, Sound), and Niclas Rummler (Dialogue System) to bring this desert fantasy adventure to life.",

    reflections: `Prophecy of Ash was an ambitious and highly demanding learning experience that tested both my technical and leadership skills. As the lead programmer and vision keeper, I was responsible for guiding the programming team, implementing AI, gameplay systems, and ensuring a robust and scalable core loop. I also coached less experienced programmers, providing daily support and knowledge transfer while maintaining active development on the game’s key systems.

One major challenge was navigating a lack of design clarity and limited production planning. Incomplete feature definitions, unreliable design input, and outsourced components forced me to prioritize development and problem-solving under tight deadlines. Managing these responsibilities on top of technical implementation created significant stress, particularly when integrating complex systems like enemy scaling, loot, and the Day-Night cycle.

Reflecting on the project, I learned the critical importance of clear communication, proactive planning, and documenting decisions. Supporting my team and maintaining cohesion amid a large, diverse group strengthened my leadership and mentoring abilities. Despite the challenges, I am proud of delivering a functional vertical slice with a playable core loop, solid technical foundation, and coherent game systems, and I carry these lessons forward to improve efficiency and collaboration in future projects.`,
