    description: "Prophecy of Ash is set within the vast desert canyons of Solmora — the final refuge of the elven races after their lands were consumed by a spreading corruption. Take the role of an emergent hero in the Last Refuge, explore a map filled with dangerous foes, and develop your magical and melee prowess to stem the tide of corruption. The game features tactical real-time combat, level and equipment-based progression, a main quest with multiple stages, and ten different side quests, each with their own sub-stages.",
