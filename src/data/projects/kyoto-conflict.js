    description: `Step into the pulsating heart of a futuristic Japanese suburb where neon-lit streets and advanced technology blend seamlessly with ancient traditions. Kyoto Conflict is an online-only first-person shooter that thrusts players into a brutal fight for dominance over a coveted artifact—a helmet of immense power capable of turning the tide of battle. Players must either storm enemy strongholds in daring raids or defend their sacred temple against relentless assault. The game features dynamic movement with bunny hopping mechanics, a unique capture/defend game mode combining Capture the Flag with attacker/defender gameplay, and strategic FOB capture points.`,
    shortDescription: "A fast-paced online FPS set in a futuristic Japanese suburb, blending advanced movement mechanics with tactical capture-and-defend gameplay. Built in Unreal Engine 5.5.",
    team: `Developed by a Games Academy student team over 8 weeks in 2024/25, following the vision of Marcel Pospiech. As one of three programmers working under Marc Hoffmann (Lead Programmer) alongside Nils Hähndel, I collaborated with 3 producers, 6 artists, 1 game designer, and numerous external specialists to create this fast-paced multiplayer FPS experience.`,

    reflections: `Koyoto Conflict was a challenging and rewarding learning experience that tested both my technical skills and collaborative abilities. 
    I focused on gameplay development, implementing the core game loop, multiplayer replication, player interactions, and later taking full responsibility 
    for audio integration. Working with both internal and external team members, I ensured key gameplay systems were synchronized across the network and 
    that interactions, pickups, and spawn points functioned reliably.
    One major challenge was balancing project needs with personal learning goals. I adapted to an external programmer’s Blueprint-only approach to maintain 
    compatibility, which sometimes conflicted with my goal of working in C++ to improve structured and extendable coding practices. Additionally, late-stage 
    responsibilities for audio integration introduced unforeseen technical complications due to unfamiliar plugins in a multiplayer context. The project 
    also highlighted the impact of weak pre-production, emphasizing the importance of early alignment, a clear design plan, and establishing a centralized 
    knowledge base.
    Reflecting on the project, I learned the value of strong planning, adaptability, and collaboration. Supporting colleagues, mentoring when possible, 
    and prioritizing effectively in the face of shifting responsibilities strengthened the team and enhanced the overall project outcome. Despite the 
    challenges, I am proud of the systems I implemented, the teamwork fostered, and the lessons learned, which will guide my approach to future projects.`,
