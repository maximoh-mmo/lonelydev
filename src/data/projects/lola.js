    description: `Lola is a 2.5D side-scrolling puzzle adventure following a lost bunny navigating a dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish world. Players guide Lola through levels, using abilities such as jumping, climbing, picking up, carrying, and dropping objects, while collecting key elements to progress. The game combines narrative, puzzle-solving, and exploration in a stylized 3D environment.`,
    team: 'Lola was developed by a small team of two over the course of 3 weeks: Julia, responsible for design, art, animation, and asset creation, and myself, handling programming, gameplay logic, UI and menu structures, audio integration, and animation implementation.
