    description: `Lost Keepers is a stylized 3D platform adventure inspired by Zelda, focusing on exploration, environmental puzzles, and player-driven discovery. Players follow the protagonist, Lyra, as she navigates a dungeon castle environment, using “Ghost” artifacts—magical companions like Kealen, a shield—to interact with the world and solve intricate puzzles. Each artifact provides unique abilities that are essential for progression, encouraging creative problem-solving and strategic use of tools. Currently in development using Unreal Engine 5.6, the project is a collaborative effort among friends, acquaintances, and fellow students, combining narrative, puzzle design, and stylized visuals into an engaging adventure.`,
