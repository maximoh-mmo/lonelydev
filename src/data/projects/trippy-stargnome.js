    description: `Trippy Stargnome is a fast-paced, 3D sci-fi rail shooter where players blast through vibrant, surreal landscapes on a mission to repel waves of alien invaders. While the player's path through the level is tethered to a predefined route, movement remains free within the rail's boundaries, allowing for precise aiming, evasive maneuvers, and obstacle avoidance. Gameplay combines quick reflexes with tactical weapon use, offering a diverse arsenal including rapid-fire projectiles, guided missiles, and high-energy lasers. Levels feature dynamic enemy formations, environmental hazards, and collectible power-ups to keep the action unpredictable and engaging.`,

    team: `Developed by a 7-person team: one producer, three designers, two artists, and myself as the sole programmer. My work encompassed all gameplay programming, UI design and implementation, AI systems, audio integration, and gameplay polish.`,
    contributions: [
      ['Waypoint-Based Rail System','Engineered a fully editable waypoint system, enabling level designers to easily define and adjust the player\'s route within the Unreal Engine editor. This approach streamlined iteration and allowed for rapid level design experimentation.'],
      ['Dynamic Spawn System','Built a flexible spawn system supporting random and fixed enemy positions along the flight path. Iterated multiple versions to balance pacing, challenge, and visual performance.'],
      ['Combat Systems', 'Developed a modular weapon framework supporting multiple weapon types, from projectiles to guided missiles and lasers, each with distinct firing mechanics and effects. Implemented power-up collection and integration into combat flow.'],
      ['User Interface','Designed and implemented responsive UI elements for player health, ammunition, score, and kill streak tracking, ensuring clear and intuitive player feedback during intense gameplay moments.'],
      ['Audio Integration','Implemented adaptive audio cues and effects for weapons, enemies, and environmental events, enhancing immersion and player situational awareness.'],
      ['Technical Support & Git Management','Maintained the project’s Git workflow and provided technical support to the team, resolving issues with builds, version control, and Unreal Engine project setup.'],
      ['Visual Effects & Shaders','Explored and implemented visual effects using Shader Graph and particle systems to enhance the psychedelic aesthetic of the world and weapon interactions.']

    reflections: `Trippy Stargnome was an incredible learning experience that tested both my technical and collaborative abilities. 
    As the sole programmer, I was responsible for implementing all gameplay systems, from player movement and weapon mechanics 
    to enemy spawning and UI functionality. Our team managed time effectively, avoiding crunch by maintaining strong communication and clear deliverables before each gate. 
  
    One major challenge was managing project scope — balancing creativity and feasibility with our available resources and experience. 
    While we faced interpersonal challenges and occasional conflict over design directions, we navigated these by focusing on collaboration and 
    maintaining respect for one another’s expertise. If I could approach the project again, I’d apply a stronger leadership role in resolving 
    creative disputes early and focus more on performance optimization from the outset.

    The final product showcased our teamwork and ambition, earning us the opportunity to present at the Goldmaster Live event — 
    a major highlight and affirmation of our efforts. I’m proud of what we achieved and grateful for the lessons learned, which I’ll carry forward into future projects.`,
