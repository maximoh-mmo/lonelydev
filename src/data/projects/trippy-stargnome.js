    description: `Trippy Stargnome is a fast-paced, 3D sci-fi rail shooter where players blast through vibrant, surreal landscapes on a mission to repel waves of alien invaders. While the player's path through the level is tethered to a predefined route, movement remains free within the rail's boundaries, allowing for precise aiming, evasive maneuvers, and obstacle avoidance. Gameplay combines quick reflexes with tactical weapon use, offering a diverse arsenal including rapid-fire projectiles, guided missiles, and high-energy lasers. Levels feature dynamic enemy formations, environmental hazards, and collectible power-ups to keep the action unpredictable and engaging.`,
