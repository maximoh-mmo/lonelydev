    description: `SteamBrawl is a tactical online multiplayer auto-battler set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world. Playable with 2-8 players (8 being ideal), players take the role of combat factions in an epic contest. Through a round-based system, they buy, upgrade, and place combat units, duel other players, with winners advancing to a grand Battle Royale at the end of each round. The game continues until only one player remains standing, combining strategic unit management with intense multiplayer competition.`,
    shortDescription: "An 8-player online auto-battler set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world, where players recruit, upgrade, and position units before clashing in tactical duels. Built in Unreal Engine 5.4 over 10 weeks.",
    team: `Developed by an 8-person Games Academy student team over 10 weeks. As one of two programmers alongside Marc Hoffmann who took the "Lead" role, I worked with 2 artists, 2 game designers, and 2 producers, plus an external composer, to create this ambitious multiplayer auto-battler from concept to completion.`,

    reflections: `Steambrawl was a rewarding learning experience that tested both my technical skills and collaborative abilities. 
    I contributed to UI production, AI movement and combat logic, animation, visual effects, audio integration, and battle result calculations, 
    quickly adapting to Unreal Engine and Blueprints. One major challenge was managing time and scope, especially with late-arriving assets, 
    while also navigating self-doubt and refining how I communicated ideas within the team. Reflecting on the project, I learned the importance 
    of early planning, structured communication, and leveraging available resources to accelerate learning. Iâ€™m proud of the technical 
    contributions I made and the collaborative environment we maintained, and I carry these lessons forward to future projects.`,
