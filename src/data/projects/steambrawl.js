    description: `SteamBrawl is a tactical online multiplayer auto-battler set in a post-apocalyptic steampunk world. Playable with 2-8 players (8 being ideal), players take the role of combat factions in an epic contest. Through a round-based system, they buy, upgrade, and place combat units, duel other players, with winners advancing to a grand Battle Royale at the end of each round. The game continues until only one player remains standing, combining strategic unit management with intense multiplayer competition.`,
