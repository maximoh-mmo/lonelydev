        Precision in Pattern: Exploring Kumiko Joinery

        A study in patience, precision, and the quiet intersection of craft and code.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-10 leading-relaxed">
        Kumiko joinery — the traditional Japanese art of assembling intricate wooden
        patterns without nails or glue — fascinated me the moment I discovered it.
        It’s a discipline defined by geometry, iteration, and a calm respect for
        process — qualities that feel deeply familiar from programming.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-12 leading-relaxed">
        What began as a curiosity about pattern and structure evolved into a
        hands-on exploration of precision and flow — learning how small adjustments
        compound, how rhythm emerges from repetition, and how order takes shape
        through patience.

        First Attempt — Learning the Language of Wood
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        My introduction to Kumiko began with a simple <strong>square-grid Asanoha pattern</strong>,
        hand-cut from leftover scrap wood. I later discovered that material was
        <strong> basswood</strong> — soft and prone to tearing under the chisel,
        which made it challenging to achieve the crisp lines the pattern relies on.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Even so, the process was revealing. Every tiny deviation — a slightly off
        angle, a cut a fraction too deep — propagated across the grid, breaking the
        visual harmony. It was a direct, tactile lesson in how small errors
        compound through a system — something I know well from programming.

        Refinement — Finding the Right Materials
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        After that first experiment, I began using <strong>limewood</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>beech</strong>, and <strong>walnut</strong> — each with distinct
        grain and resistance that suited different parts of the pattern. The denser
        woods held cleaner edges and offered beautiful contrast when combined in a
        single piece.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Choosing materials became its own design language — matching mechanical
        properties with visual goals, like balancing performance and aesthetics in
        a game system.

        Iteration and Improvement
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        With better materials came better results. I built a{" "}
        <strong>small decorative panel</strong>, cutting every strip and joint
        entirely by hand. Each iteration improved the accuracy of my jigs and the
        consistency of my workflow — a very real-world form of iterative problem
        solving.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Once I found the rhythm — cut, test, adjust, repeat — the process became
        meditative. It required the same quiet focus and steady iteration as
        refining a gameplay mechanic or debugging a tricky system.

        When the <strong>small panel</strong> was finished and trimmed to size, the
        geometry came alive in light and shadow. To display it properly, I designed
        and built a <strong>custom frame</strong>, experimenting with tight miters
        and contrasting tones of beech and walnut.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Seeing the panel mounted for the first time felt like seeing a finished

        Working entirely by hand made Kumiko a study in control, patience, and

        cuts, more precise jigs — was earned through repetition and self-correction.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Kumiko, at its core, is about harmony — between precision and intuition,

        Both disciplines reward patience and iterative thinking. Both demand
