    description: `Step into the pulsating heart of a futuristic Japanese suburb where neon-lit streets and advanced technology blend seamlessly with ancient traditions. Kyoto Conflict is an online-only first-person shooter that thrusts players into a brutal fight for dominance over a coveted artifact—a helmet of immense power capable of turning the tide of battle. Players must either storm enemy strongholds in daring raids or defend their sacred temple against relentless assault. The game features dynamic movement with bunny hopping mechanics, a unique capture/defend game mode combining Capture the Flag with attacker/defender gameplay, and strategic FOB capture points.`,
    team: `Developed by a Games Academy student team over 8 weeks in 2024/25, following the vision of Marcel Pospiech. As one of three programmers working under Marc Hoffmann (Lead Programmer) alongside Nils Hähndel, I collaborated with 3 producers, 6 artists, 1 game designer, and numerous external specialists to create this fast-paced multiplayer FPS experience.`,
    contributions: [
      ['Advanced Movement System', 'Implemented fluid first-person movement mechanics including dynamic bunny hopping systems that allow players to gain speed advantages, dodge enemy fire, and approach combat from unexpected angles, creating the fast-paced gameplay core to the experience.'],
      ['Multiplayer Respawn Systems', 'Developed robust respawn mechanics for the online-only multiplayer environment, managing player spawning logic, team balance, and strategic spawn point selection to maintain competitive flow during intense capture/defend scenarios.'],
      ['User Interface Design', 'Created comprehensive UI systems for this competitive FPS, including HUD elements for health, ammunition, objective status, team information, and real-time match progression feedback essential for the capture/defend gameplay mode.']
